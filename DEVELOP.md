### Philosophies for Better Engineering

* The `lingua` folder should contain only commonly used classes and functions, avoiding application-specific elements.
* Each model or pipeline should have its own dedicated folder within the `apps` directory.
* Each Pull Request should focus on a specific new feature (e.g., adding CFG support, implementing a new architecture, or introducing new configurations) and include a detailed test plan to facilitate effective code review.
